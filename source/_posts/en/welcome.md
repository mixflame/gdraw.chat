Welcome to GlobalChat Draw! GlobalChat Draw is an encrypted chat with a collaborative drawing canvas and end-to-end encrypted private messages.

GlobalChat uses its own open protocol, which allows for encrypted sign on and password hashing. All messages sent through GlobalChat are automatically encrypted.

End to end encryption of private messages means that no one, including the server, will be able to read your messages.

GlobalChat Draw is currently a macOS app with a Ubuntu Linux snap to run the server, but other cross platform implementations of the GlobalChat protocol are being implemented.
